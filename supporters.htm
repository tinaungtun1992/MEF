            <h1>Supporters</h1>
			<p>MEF receives no major financial assistance from the Thai government or other organizations. The program is financially supported by the local and international Burmese community, some organizations as well as other family and friends. With these funds, MEF has been able to operate for a year, providing food, accommodation and educational materials to its students.</p>

			<p>A crucial factor in the progress of MEF has been the array of volunteer teachers, who have taught as well as added valuable input into the development of the program. Teachers from various countries such as Burma, New Zealand, Sri Lanka, Australia, England, Canada, Hong Kong, USA, Philippines, Sweden, Denmark, Germany, and Singapore have volunteered their time and energy at the school, for varying periods, in order to promote the educational development of Burmese youth.</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.badasf.org/" target="_blank" title="Burmese American Democratic Alliance">Burmese American Democratic Alliance (BADA)</a> has been a loyal supporter of MEF since 2007, giving donations on a monthly basis. They have also pledged to continue funding in 2009, as well as visiting regularly to gain further understanding of MEF and its goals. MEF is also supported by the Coordinating Body of <a href="http://maetaoclinic.org/" target="_blank" title="Mae Tao Clinic">Mae Tao Clinic,</a> which have been providing some food and funds on a monthly basis since October 2007. However, these donations fluctuate and are not dependable.</p>

			<p><a href="http://worlded-thailand.org/" target="_blank" title="World Education Consortium (WEC)">World Education Consortium (WEC) Thailand</a> provides educational support to MEF, ranging from school supplies to technical advice. Another supporter of MEF is <a href="http://worlded-thailand.org/" target="_blank" title="Child's Dream (CD)">Child’s Dream (CD).</a> CD generously funded the first group of students in the MHEF program to take the high school test in 2009. This was an important step for MEF, as it has given the program an opportunity to continue as well as expand.</p>

			<p><a href="https://www.zoho.com/" target="_blank" title="Zoho.com">Zoho.com</a> supports MEF with their Zoho Email Suite for 75 email accounts. Thanks to this generous offer from Zoho, we are able to give all our students their own mailboxes. This makes it possible to train our students how to make good use of their email. A skill that is essential for the future of our students.</p>

			<p>Urgence Culture Mémoire et Développement, based in France, has financially supported MEF with a donation of 5,000 Euros in September 2012 for monthly school supplies. These donations allow us to monthly photocopies and student supplies. This support is crucial to running our education program. We are very grateful to UCMD for the important contribution to our school.</p>

			<p>MEF has also been fortunate enough to have had the support of <a href="http://www.mc.edu.ph/" target="_blank" title="Miriam">Miriam </a>College in the Philippines, who have done workshops with the students on various social science topics; <a href="http://www.mapfoundationcm.org/" target="_blank" title="Migrant Assistance Program (MAP)">Migrant Assistance Program (MAP) in Chiang Mai, </a>who have done regular trainings on migrant rights, migrant education and HIV/AIDS; the <a href="http://www.socsc.hku.hk/" target="_blank" title="Migrant Outreach Education Initiative (MOEI)">Migrant Outreach Education Initiative (MOEI) </a>program which provides short-term volunteer teachers; and various university lecturers who visited MEF to give talks on a range of subjects.</p>

			<p>Many organizations and individuals have donated and continue to donate office supplies, food, clothing, school equipment and various other supplies on a regular basis. We always need more, but without these valuable contributions, MEF would not be able to provide quality education and services to its students.</p>
