			<p>Burma has often been called the “Golden Land”, a name used to describe this South-East Asian paradise, as it is rich in many natural resources and its land is of great beauty. It is populated by people from many different ethnic groups, each with its own individual culture and language. However, the country has been troubled for many years, since the beginning of military rule. It has gone from being the highest rice producer in the 1930’s to the status of least developed country over the last three decades.</p>

			<p>In the past 45 years, there has been immense civil unrest and political turmoil, which has left thousands dead and millions displaced across the country. The military government, State Peace and Development Council (SPDC), is one of the most brutal, corrupt and repressive regimes in the world. They use murder, torture, rape, political imprisonment, landmines, land confiscation, and forced labor as some practices for ruling the citizens of Burma, while continually violating their human rights. Freedom of expression and freedom of association are non-existent and Burmese citizens are denied any say in the shaping of their future.</p>

			<p>Living standards have deteriorated steadily during the 45 years of military rule. Conditions are generally worse in the seven states where the majority of the ethnic minorities reside. There are not sufficient funds for basic health and education services because of persistent government refusal to allocate any part of its budget to a non-military sector. Over 60 per cent is spent on military, in comparison to less than eight per cent of the budget being spent on education by the government.</p>

			<p>Each year, thousands of people flee Burma. The growing economic hardships within the country have forced many people across the borders leaving their homes and villages. The numbers of Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) and refugees keeps increasing, as they escape forced relocation or fighting in ethnic areas. There is also a massive influx of migrant workers in bordering countries, trying to survive and feed their families. Political activists, who have sacrificed their lives for the fight for democracy and their people are also escaping or seeking refuge in order to avoid imprisonment, torture or the result of blacklisting against their families.</p>

			<p>Bordering countries have provided shelters for these exiled communities. However they are not permanent. Most people are waiting for change in Burma so they can go home and rebuild their country. This has been a long wait for some, while others seek asylum in third countries where they can start their lives again.</p>
