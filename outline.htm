				Program
			</div>
			
			<P>The program provides a nurturing environment for students to develop, not just academically but also as strong individuals who take pride in their country and the environment around them. MEF continually provides its students with comprehensive knowledge on community and international issues, while also providing education on human rights, democracy and environment issues. This promotes the new generation to love and have a commitment for their country and at the global level.</P> 	
           
			<P>After passing the high school examination at the end of the program, students will obtain a certificate in order to apply for higher education. Moreover, with its comprehensive curriculum, the course provides students with the relevant skills - including critical thinking, analysis and the expression of their ideas - vital during their university years and beyond.</P>
			<P>An accredited certificate is an essential measure for those students who don’t have any opportunity to gain a high school certificate. Therefore, this is the immediate goal of the program. However, MEF has a broader goal of educating youth from Burma to have a commitment to their country and people, and a passion to continue the struggle to obtain quality education. To achieve this, MEF includes an extra subject (Burma Issues) in the curriculum which will educate students on the situation inside Burma as well as exploring solutions and connections to the global community.</P>

			<P>MEF currently operates with the support of Burmese organizations in Mae Sot and round the world. The program is managed on a daily basis by the MEF Management Team and overseen by the MEF Board of Directors. Staff includes international and Burmese teachers, volunteer and office staff. Periodic evaluations are conducted to assess the operation and development of the program, as well as the progress of the students and their future education.</P>

			<P>MEF, along with all migrant education centers in Mae Sot, is in the process of being registered with the Ministry of Education (MoE) of Thailand. We will continue to cooperate with MoE and follow all regulations specified in 2009-2010.</P>

			<P>The students at Minmahaw Education Foundation (MEF) are divided into two separate programs, according to their academic level.</P>
